# Ionic PWA Toolkit Alpha

The PWA Toolkit is a starting point for building Progressive Web Apps using Ionic and Stencil.
This combination of tools gives you the ability to build a fast, efficient PWA out of the box.

Note: This project is **ALPHA** and uses an early release of `@ionic/core`

## Features

* `@ionic/core` for the UI.
* Stencil for the application logic and routing
* Push Notifications setup
* Unit Tests
* Pre-rendering
* Lazy-loading and code splitting
* Intelligent Polyfills
* Modern mode: ES6/ESM for new browser, ES5 for older
* Service Worker, App manifest, iOS meta tags
* Theming using CSS variables

## Getting Started

To start building, clone this repo to a new directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-pwa-toolkit.git my-app
cd my-app
git remote rm origin
```

and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Production

To build for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

A production build includes:

* Minified code bundles
* Generated Service workers
* App manifest

## Hosting

Apps should be hosted on through HTTPS, and if possible, through a provider that supports HTTP2.
One provider that does support this is [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/).

## H2 Push

We recommend setting up HTTP2 Push on Firebase. H2 Push may sound complicated, but it's actually a simple concept. To learn about it, take a look at this [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2_Server_Push).

To set this up for `my-app`:

* Do a production build of the app: `npm run build`
* Serve your WWW folder locally using a local http server and open in your browser.
  * https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server works pretty well for this. You can serve your www folder by running `http-server www`.
* Open the DevTools and look at the network tab.
  * Reload the page and you should see all of your files show up in the network tab. Excluding the `sw.js` file, these are the files you want to H2 push.
* List these files in the link headers of your firebase.json file. For a syntax reference, review this [article](https://w3c.github.io/preload/#server-push-http-2)

## Service Workers

Service workers are generated via the Stencil build tool. For more information on how they can be configured, see the [Service Worker docs](https://stenciljs.com/docs/service-workers).

## Developing with a Service Worker

For most cases, you'll want to develop your app without generating a Service Worker. But if you'd like to test out Web Push Notifications or Background Sync, you'll need to have one generated. To generate a Service Worker during dev builds, we've added the npm script `devWithSW`. This will start a dev build and generate a Service Worker as well.

## Unit Tests

To run the unit tests once, run:

```bash
npm test
```

To run the unit tests and watch for file changes during development, run:

```bash
npm run test.watch
```

## Testing your PWA's performance

We recommend using https://www.webpagetest.org/easy with the `Run Lighthouse Audit` option turned on.
This will give you an in depth look into your app's load performance on the average device connected to the average network.
